# CST-221

This is my introdcution to my CST-221 git repository! 
I am Johnathan and I am a computer programming major at GCU.
I really enjoy playing sports like Basketball and Golf but I truly play everything!
Whether I am coding or playing sports as long as I can have a group of friends around me with great vibes I am the most happiest!
